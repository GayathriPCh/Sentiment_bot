# Sentiment_bot


 implemented a bidirectional LSTM with dropout, learning rate adjustments, and callbacks like EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau! 

fine-tuned hyperparameters like:
✅ Bidirectional LSTM for better context understanding
✅ Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
✅ Adaptive learning rate using ReduceLROnPlateau
✅ Early stopping to avoid unnecessary training cycles
